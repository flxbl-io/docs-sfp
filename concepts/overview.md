# Overview



sfp is a purpose built cli tool used predominantly in a modular salesforce project.  \

\
A project utilising sfp is built around these concepts\
\
[**Domains**](domains.md)

In an sfp-powered Salesforce project, "Domains" represent distinct business capabilities for which features are developed. A project can encompass multiple domains, and each domain may include various `sub-domains`. Domains are not explicitly declared within sfp but are conceptually organized through "[**Release Configs**](release-config.md)"

[**Packages**](packages.md)\
\
A package (synonymous with modules) is a container used to group related metadata together.  A package would contain components such as objects, fields, apex, flows and more allowing these elements to be easily installed, upgraded and managed as a single unit. A package is defined a directory in your project repository and is defined by an entry in sfdx-project.json

[**Artifacts**](artifacts.md)

An artifact represents a versioned snapshot of a package at a specific point in time. It includes the source code from the package directory (as specified in `sfdx-project.json`), along with metadata about the version, change logs, and other relevant details. Artifacts are the deployable units in the sfp framework, ensuring consistency and traceability across the development lifecycle.\
\
When sfp is integrated into a Salesforce project, it centralizes around the the following key essential process

[**Building a domain**](../building-artifacts/overview.md)

Building' refers to the creation of an artifact from a package. Utilizing the `build` command, sfp facilitates the generation of artifacts for each package in your repository. This process encapsulates the package's source code and metadata into a versioned artifact, ready for installation.

[**Publishing a domain**](../publishing-and-fetching-artifacts/publish-artifact.md)

Publishing a domain  involves the process of publishing the artifacts generated by the build command into an artifact repository. This is the storage area from where the artifacts are fetched for releases, rollback etc.

[**Releasing a domain**](../release-management/release.md)

Releasing an domain  involves the process of promoting, installing a collection of artifacts to a higher org such as production, generating an associated  changelog for the domain.  This process  is driven by the release command along with a [release definition](../release-management/release-definitions.md).

In addition to building and releasing a domain, sfp has addtional key process when applied to a context of a larger project, these are
