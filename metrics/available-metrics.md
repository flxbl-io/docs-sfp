# Available Metrics

sfp is built with metrics on every key activity. The below table provides a list of metrics emitted from sfp. One can forward these metrics into any observability system. sfp supports native integration to DataDog, NewRelic and Splunk. sfp also has a statsD forwarder, which you can utilize to connect to any other observability tools. Utilizing these metrics, you can build dashboards that can provide visibility into your process.

## Metric Tags

All metrics include contextual tags that help you filter and aggregate data:

### Default Tags
- **branch**: Git branch name (when applicable)
- **package**: Package name (for package-specific metrics)
- **environment**: Target environment (for deployment/release metrics)
- **status**: Operation status (success/failure)
- **repo**: GitHub repository (automatically added in GitHub Actions)

### Custom Tags (sfp-pro only)
With sfp-pro, you can configure custom tags that are automatically added to ALL metrics. See [Custom Metrics](custom-metrics.md#custom-tags-configuration) for details on setting up organizational tags like team, cost-center, project, etc.
