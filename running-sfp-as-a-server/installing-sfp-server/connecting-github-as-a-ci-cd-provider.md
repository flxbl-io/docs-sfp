# Connecting GitHub as a CI/CD provider

sfp-pro server require additional permissions which allow to write into your repository, sync environments and also permission to trigger workflows etc.

These permissions are beyond what is being provided by the built in GITHUB\_TOKEN. A Github App is recommended over using a Service Account and its Personal Access Token, as the service account takes an additional license and has limitations on the api requests.

This guide is crafted to facilitate the user to create a sfops-bot GitHub App to integrate with sfp-server. It provides a step-by-step approach for creating the app, elaborating on the necessary permissions, installation, and secure storage of sensitive information. \

{% hint style="warning" %}
You would also need to configure a GITHUB\_TOKEN env variable, which has the following scope, packages:write and repo:read \
\
This is due to the fact the GITHUB Apps  currently do not support operations on GitHub packages.
