# Release Config

Release configuration is a fundamental setup that outlines the organisation of packages within a project, streamlining across different lifecycle of your project, such as validating, building, deploying/release of artifacts. In flxbl projects, a release config is used to define the concept of a domain/subdomains.\
\
This configuration is instrumental when using sfp commands, as it allows for selective operations on specified packages defined by a configuration. By employing a release configuration, teams can efficiently manage a mono repository of packages  across various teams.&#x20;

A release configuration also can contain additional options that can be used by certain sfp commands to generate [release definitions](../releasing-artifacts/release-definitions.md). These properties in a release definiton alters the behaviour of deployment of artifacts during a release
