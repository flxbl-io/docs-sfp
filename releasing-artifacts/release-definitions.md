# Release Definitions

A release definition is a YAML file that carries attributes of artifacts and other details. A release definition is the main input for a release command.&#x20;

```
release: Sprint-2-13-11-6844956242
skipIfAlreadyInstalled: true
artifacts:
  feature-management: 1.0.19-6844956242
  apex-logger: 1.0.20-89
promotePackagesBeforeDeploymentToOrg: prod
changelog:
  workItemFilters:
    - (FGK|FFK)-[0-9]{3,4}
  workItemUrl: https://flxbl.atlassian.net/browse
  limit: 30
```

Lets examine closely the above release definition file and understand the various attributes and it purposes

```
release: Sprint-2-13-11-6844956242
```

This defines the name of the release. this value will be utilised to generate changelogs or as an identification for other systems to understand what release went into an org&#x20;

```
skipIfAlreadyInstalled: true
```

This attribute determines whether artifacts should be skipped from installing if the same version number is already installed in the target org

```
artifacts:
  feature-management: 1.0.19-6844956242
  apex-logger: 1.0.20-89
```

This attribute determines which artifacts constitute the provided release.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, when using release definition with exact version numbers. The format of the version number would be \<packageName>: X.Y.Z-BuildNumber, where the version number adopts the following semantics\
X - Major\
Y - Minor\
Z - Patch\
BuildNumber - The build number that produced the package\
\
The version exactly follows the semantics used by the artifact registry (such as Github Packages). However the format is slightly different from the version that is tagged in the git repository where it follows X.Y.Z.BuildNumber

**Example**:\
A package that has the version core\_crm\_v3.0.0.6936, tagged in git should be referenced\
as core\_crm: 3.0.0-6936&#x20;
{% endhint %}

```
promotePackagesBeforeDeploymentToOrg: <targetOrgAlias>
```

The above attribute determines whether an artifact of type unlocked package should be promoted before installing into the target org as provided by the alias. If the alias of the requested org and the targeOrgAlias matches, the unlocked packages are promoted before installing into the org

The reminder of the attributes are about generating change log, which are explained [here](generating-a-changelog.md)
